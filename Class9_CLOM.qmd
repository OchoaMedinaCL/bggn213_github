PDB_df <- read.csv("/Users/celiaochoamedina/Desktop/Winter_2025/Bioinformatics/Projects/Data Export Summary.csv") 

```

Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
```{r}

total <- sum(PDB_df$Total)
cat(total_count)
```

freq_table <- table(data_df$is_subscriber)
subscribers_count <- sum(data_df$is_subscriber)
mean_sub <-mean(data_df$is_subscriber)*100
cat(mean_sub, "% subscribers")
```
